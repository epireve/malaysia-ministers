Emulating Rahman, Taib disbursed timber concessions to his family members and cronies in order to consolidate his power. ... The privatisation of profitable state enterprises from both the negeri and central governments facilitated the setting up of Taib family-owned business conglomerate in Sarawak known as the CMS Group. Although it is difficult to estimate the total value of Taib's wealth, his family control of timber concessions and CMS's widespread involvement in the various economic sectors provides a glimpse of the strongman-politician's economic standing. (pages 119-120) By amending Forest Bill, Taib tightened his grip on the distribution of timber licence at the expense of Rahman supporters. (page 156)",

Besides the fact that licensing decisions are made by the Chief Minister in his additional function as state Minister of Resource Planning,[50] new legislation has been introduced that grants the Chief Minister alone the power to revoke timber concessions. No legal challenge to the revocation of licences is now possible and no reasons need be given. This ensures that anyone with a logging interest remains loyal to the Chief Minister or risks losing their licence. Such close connections between politics and timber exploitation means that there is little incentive to protect forests or to protect and enforce native people's rights.",
